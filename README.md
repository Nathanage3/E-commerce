- **[E-commerce](https://github.com/Nathanage3/E-commerce.git)**: <br /> -**ProLearn: A Full-Stack Course E-Commerce Platform**
A feature-rich, full-stack e-commerce platform for selling and managing online courses, built with a decoupled architecture. The backend is a robust RESTful API powered by Django & Django REST Framework, and the frontend is a dynamic, responsive client built with React.

This repository contains the backend (API) portion of the project.

    Implementing secure, token-based user authentication (JWT).

    Writing logic for course management, filtering, user enrollments, and payment processing.

    Managing the project using a feature-branch Git workflow for seamless collaboration.

üöÄ **Core Features**

User Authentication: Secure user registration and login using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

- **üì¶ Local Installation & Setup**

To run the backend server locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[Nathanage3/E-commerce.git
cd E-commerce


2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate


3. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory by copying the example file.

cp .env.example .env


Open the .env file and fill in the required variables (like SECRET_KEY). You can generate a new Django secret key here.

5. Run database migrations:

python manage.py migrate


6. Run the development server:

python manage.py runserver


The backend API will now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

7. Set up the Frontend:

Clone the frontend repository and follow its README.md file for installation.

Ensure the frontend's API (Axios) base URL is pointed at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

**ü§ù Collaboration**

This project was a collaborative effort, developed using a feature-branch Git workflow. This decoupled approach allowed for parallel development on the backend API and the frontend client, with clear API contracts ensuring smooth integration.
